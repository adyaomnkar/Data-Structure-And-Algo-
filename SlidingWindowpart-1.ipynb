    "You are given an array of card points and a number K.<br>\n",
    "You can pick exactly K cards, but only from the left end or the right end.<br>\n",
    "Your goal is to maximize the total points obtained.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Initial Thought<br>\n",
    "If you take all K cards from the left side, you get a valid starting sum.<br>\n",
    "This is used as the initial maximum sum.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Left Sum Calculation<br>\n",
    "Add the first K elements of the array and store it in lsum.<br>\n",
    "This represents taking all K cards from the left side.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Right Sum Setup<br>\n",
    "Initialize rsum = 0 to store points taken from the right side.<br>\n",
    "Set rindex to the last index of the array.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Shifting Cards from Left to Right<br>\n",
    "Now remove one card at a time from the left sum.<br>\n",
    "At the same time, add one card from the right end to the right sum.<br>\n",
    "This simulates taking fewer cards from the left and more from the right.<br><br>\n",

    "6) Loop Logic<br>\n",
    "For each step:<br>\n",
    "– Subtract nums[i] from lsum (removing a left card)<br>\n",
    "– Add nums[rindex] to rsum (adding a right card)<br>\n",
    "– Move rindex leftward<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Update Maximum Sum<br>\n",
    "At each step, calculate total points using (lsum + rsum).<br>\n",
    "Update maxsum if this value is greater than the previous maximum.<br><br>\n",

    "After all combinations are checked, maxsum stores the maximum points possible.<br>\n",
    "Return maxsum as the answer.<br><br>\n",

    "Instead of checking all combinations, we smartly shift cards from left to right.<br>\n",
